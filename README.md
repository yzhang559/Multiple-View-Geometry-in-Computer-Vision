# Multiple-View-Geometry-in-Computer-Vision

A transformation that maps lines to lines (but does not necessarily preserve parallelism) is a projective transformation.
This matlab library helps you find the projective transformation matrix H (non-singular 3 × 3 matrix) given 4 pairs of non-collinear points in original and projective 2d indexed images. Also you can apply projective transformation on any image with matrix H. 

# Example
A example is provided in main.m, input image is in image folder. You can download and run it.
